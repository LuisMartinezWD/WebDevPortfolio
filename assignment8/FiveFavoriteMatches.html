			<h1>#1 Shield Triple<br>Threat</h1>
			<p class="size">
The WWE Shield Triple Threat match was<br> amazing because it wrapped up a long story<br> between Roman Reigns, Seth Rollins, and <br>Dean Ambrose. Their friendship and history<br> made it really intense. The way they<br> wrestled together,with Roman's strength,<br> Seth's flips, and Dean's brawling,<br> was really cool. The match was exciting and <br>kept us guessing, and you could tell <br>they were real friends, <br>making it a special moment in WWE.</p>

			<h1>#3 Bayley vs Sasha Banks</h1>
			<p class="size">Bayley vs Sasha is a story of the <br> Woman on top who had it all, and<br> the woman fighting from the bottom for a <br>chance at it. Bayley was always an <br>underdog and sasha, her former tag team<br>partner, did everything in her power to keep <br>the title from bayley.But in this case,<br> Bayley came out on top </p>

			<h1>#4 Aj Styles vs <br> Samoa Joe vs <br> Christopher Daniels</h1>
			<p class="size">This match is hard to give a reason<br>as to why its so good, these <br> three men just fought so valiantly<br>there was not a single second<br>of downtime,its truly an <br>amazing match. The timing,moves that were <br>used it all made sense and it fit perfectly.</p>

			<h1>#5 Jon Moxley vs<br> Brodie Lee</h1>
			<p class="size">This is a CZW classic, Brodie<br>Lee and Jon Moxley are both masterminds<br> of violence in the ring. This match gets<br>brutal, but it feels so raw and full<br>of emotion.This is my favorite work of <br>Brodie, he was a genius in the ring. <br> May he Rest In Peace.</p>
