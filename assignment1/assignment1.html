<h1>The Good and Bad of 404</h1>

<p class="text">Throughout Kate Wagners “404 Page Not Found”, she consistently brings up points describing how she has seen the internet flourish and become what it is today. However not all of her feedback has been positive, in fact she has a lot of negative things to say. I agree with a lot of her takes on what the internet has become, yet I also disagree with just as much. Specifically in the subsection “The Age of App-quarius”, there are many points that Wagner brings up that are highly interesting to me.</p>

<p class="text">For example, one aspect where I think Wagner makes a very good point yet a point I disagree with simultaneously is present here; “Mims adds, “The Web wasn’t perfect, but it created a commons where people could exchange information and goods. It forced companies to build technology that was explicitly designed to be compatible with competitors’ technology.” That accountability, everyone knows, has disappeared.” This quote is Wagner saying that the web used to be a place where everyone once shared ideas and was on a common ground, companies were forced to comply with the standards that were. Yet Wagner is portraying these big companies that moved onto apps as evil, or robbing people of a universal space to share ideas. At least in my eyes this is almost a very childlike view for Wagner to have. Don't get me wrong, I 100% agree that a universal platform for information and goods to be shared is much better than what has been created by big companies forcing you into their apps, and I wholeheartedly agree that it's a shame that these companies are getting rid of that universal platform. But it's exactly what it sounds like, these are massive companies who at the end of the day are trying to make profits. By isolating their platform they're giving themselves the best opportunity for success and eliminating competitors. Wagner seems to have a very one dimensional view of what she wants the internet to be, while I agree it's a very good view to have. It just simply isn't realistic, technology is always changing, always advancing, it only makes sense for these big companies to try and profit off of it.</p>

 <p class="text">However there is another portion of this essay that I agree with Wagner 100% on, and it's when she mentions the “blandness" of the internet. Wagner says ”Because websites had to either become apps or self-optimize for mobile, web design declined from its creative, more variegated heights to become flat, highly minimalistic, and multi-platform, and the results are, frankly, fucking boring” Wagner brings up a great point that the great variety of creativity that used to be present in web design has been overshadowed by a very bland and boring formal image. Right after this statement Wagner says, “Even sections of the web such as highly customized Tumblr blogs that do resemble the charming, amateur websites of old are, unless you go out of your way to manually open them in a new tab, assimilated into Tumblr’s infinitely scrollable “dashboard” feed—and thus rendered uniform and sterile.” This to me is very interesting, Wagner seems to be trying to make a point that having the fun and uniqueness that the web used to have isn't completely gone. Rather hidden, going back to how the web has become a place of profit, I don't see why a feature like this would be hidden. The typical boring and bland look of a uniform page and the fun and vividness of a page full of one's creativity is something that I support 100% alongside Wagner, yet the fact that it's still accessible makes me wonder if these big companies are going to try and appeal to their audience more. A sterile and bland environment is surely going to be less successful than an environment full of creativity, the fact that Wagner mentions that this creativity can still be found makes me think that she is still holding onto hope, and in a way so am I. If a company were to capitalize on this, not only would it bring back the life of the web, yet it would benefit the company itself. Wagner has a wonderful outlook on media and the web, while I may not agree with it all, that's the beauty of what the web was meant to be. A free environment for everybody to share their opinions without limit, Wagner obviously desires it to come back, and I am also hopeful it makes its return. </p>
