	<h1>Primus Sucks!</h1>
	<p> Well, this is frustrating. I’m trying to leave a comment indicating that I think this Primus video sucks, but these idiots replying are taking it as tacit approval of the band. Apparently, fans of this band—where the bassist is the star—use the term “Primus sucks” as a codeword for liking the band. So, no, I am actually trying to say Primus sucks and I am deeply disturbed that an entire fanbase lives in a permanent state of “opposite day.”</p>
 <p> How could this have happened? Perhaps it’s because the phrase “Primus sucks” is the only thought one can produce when listening to their music. One could not possibly listen to Les Claypool punch a plank of wood for four minutes and say “Yes, I enjoyed that.” The only human reaction would be to say it sucks. Because it does. But apparently, I can’t say that because people will think I approve of someone noodling on a pretend instrument while mumbling quirky lyrics. Granted, I do approve of that but only if you’ve played a Manic Pixie Dream Girl opposite Joseph Gordon-Levitt.</p>
 <p> Ugh. Of course the rallying cry for Primus fans is a clumsily veiled ironic statement. I hope you Primus fans are happy playing your twisted little game. It is disgusting. It is violating. It’s entrapment for implicit condoning instead of explicit condemnation.</p>
<p> To combat this, I’m selling shirts that say “Primus sucks, but unironically.” Please buy them to support the message of Primus being terrible, but for real this time. I’d like to see the Primus fanbase find a way to stop me now! The whole world will know that I, like so many others before me whose voices were silenced by irony, think Primus sucks!</p>

	<h1>Primus is Amazing!</h1>
<p>	While it is very true that Primus is a very strange band, their success cannot be undermined, the style of music may not be for everyone. But that's the purpose of music! For people to find what they like, there's nothing wrong with not liking Primus, but to say that they suck is complete dismissal of the raw talent the band possesses. Les Claypool who is both the vocalist and the bassist for Primus is widely regarded as one of the best bassists to ever exist, it's hard to find a top 10 list that doesnt include him. Les Claypool is a genius when it comes to playing the bass, he has written some of the most unique and catchy basslines in rock history.  However, like all music, it isn't for everyone, Les Claypool has a very southern-esque voice to the point where it sounds exaggerated or hyperbolic.</p>
<p>	Primus as a whole has seen great success, in fact many people have probably heard Primus without even knowing it. Les Claypool made such a large name for himself that he’s the man behind the South Park theme song. Moving past that if we just look at the amount of plays some of their songs get on spotify it's obvious that Primus is doing something right to accumulate this number of views. On Spotify alone their top 5 songs, being; Jerry Was A Race Car Driver, My Name Is Mud, John The Fisherman, Wynona’s Big Brown Beaver, and Too Many Puppies have accumulated just shy of 214,000,000 plays. On top of this Primus is still pulling in one million monthly listeners despite their last Ep being dropped april 22 of 2022, and their last album being released in 2017. The widespread popularity and influence of Primus is undeniable, however for even more proof, both of their albums Pork Soda and Sailing The Seas Of Cheese went platinum, while Tales From The Punch Bowl went gold. </p>
<p>	Primus is a band that has paved the way for a whole new style of bass playing, Les Claypool was an innovator when it came to his instrument and it is apparent in any one of their songs. Does Primus sound weird? Yes, absolutely. Is the content of the majority of their songs strange? Once again yes. Primus was never trying to be a cookie cutter band, they did their own thing and they made it work. Les Claypool alongside the other members have created one of the most dividing bands, however whether you like Primus or not, to deny their success and talent is the same as spitting in the face of all the members. Primus is far from terrible and to consider them terrible is an insult to all of the musicians who have been inspired by them, and for those who don't know Primus is heavily considered a huge influence to the Nu Metal genre, inspiring bands such as, Deftones, Korn, Pleymo, and Limp Bizkit. All of which have made huge names for themselves in their respective areas, Primus was and still is weird, there’s no denying that, but it is impossible to deny or belittle their success.</p>
