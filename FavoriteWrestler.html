	<h1>Why He's My Favorite</h1>
	<p>Kenny Omega is my favorite wrestler, and for good reason. Kenny Omega is widely considered one of the best wrestlers in the world, his unique and powerful moveset makes his matches feel so powerful. Every strike on his opponent feels real, his energy and enthusiasm in the ring is unmatched. Kenny knows how to get the crowd on his side, and its been like this for as long as I can remember. If we go back to New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW) we see that Kenny was still that charismatic enigma that he still is to this day. Whether it was his time as one half of the Golden Lovers alongside Kota Ibushi or his time as The Cleaner when he was the Leader of the notorious Bullet Club.</p>
	<p>By any standard Kenny is an amazing wrestler, with amazing feuds with other great wrestlers such as Okada and Will Ospreay. Despite him recently turning 40 years old and admitting himself that its harder to keep up with the younger talent, he still puts on one hell of a show. Whether its him hitting his opponent with his vicious V Trigger or pulling out his finisher The One Winged Angel, which has only been kicked out of TWICE, TWO TIMES in his 23 year long career. If we now focus on the storytelling aspect, all we need to look at is who has kicked out of his finisher. The first person to ever kick out of it was Kota Ibushi, his former tag team partner, it was an incredible match and Ibushi was the first to show Kenny he wasn't that much better than everyone else. However the only other person to kick out of the One Winged Angel happened during a match at AEW Forbidden Door, it was Kenny Omega vs Will Ospreay. And the man who kicked out was KENNY HIMSELF, Will Ospreay hoisted Kenny onto his shoulders and delivered the devastating move to the man who uses it to destroy others. If you know wrestling if the Referee gets to the count of three you know the match is over. Not only did Kenny Omega become the second man to ever kick out of his own finisher, he made it seem like the move that destroyed so many did no damage to the user itself, Kenny kicked out at 1. It was that moment where I knew that Kenny was my favorite wrestler, the move he uses that makes so many lose matches, he brushes off as if it was nothing.</p>
